# US Accident Analysis üöóüí•

An in-depth, end-to-end data analysis project exploring accident trends across the United States.  
This project dives into how weather, road conditions, time of day, and other factors contribute to accident severity ‚Äî turning raw data into actionable insights.

---

## üîç Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze U.S. accident data to:
- Identify accident-prone regions and seasons.
- Understand how weather and road conditions affect accident severity.
- Provide visual insights to support better safety planning.

## üß† Key Highlights
- Cleaned and processed **large-scale accident data** using Python and Pandas.  
- Visualized geographical and network-based patterns with **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, and NetworkX**.  
- Explored time-based trends (rush hours, weekdays vs weekends).  
- Applied clustering with **KMeans** to group similar accident zones.  
- Built multiple classification models to analyze contributing factors using:
  - **Logistic Regression**  
  - **Random Forest**  
  - **Gradient Boosting**  
  - **SGD Classifier**  
  - **XGBoost**
- Evaluated models using comprehensive metrics like **Accuracy, F1-Score, ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall, and Confusion Matrix**.  
- Employed preprocessing pipelines with **Scikit-learn**, including **StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder, ColumnTransformer, and Pipelines** for clean and repeatable workflows.

## üìà Insights Snapshot
This analysis explored the US Accidents dataset with a focus on understanding and predicting accident severity. After rigorous data cleaning and feature engineering, including temporal (Hour, DayOfWeek, Rush_Hour), environmental (Weather_Condition, Visibility_Precip), and location-based features, we trained multiple machine learning models. Random Forest and XGBoost consistently outperformed others, achieving the highest accuracy and F1-scores. Feature importance analysis highlighted that peak hours, adverse weather conditions, and low visibility are the strongest predictors of accident severity, confirming domain insights..
